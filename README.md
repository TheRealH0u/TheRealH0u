Hi, I’m @TheRealH0u
I’m currently learning computer stuff and ethical hacking
Looking to collaborate on any projects that are fun.
Would say that college is fun but It's not because I need to do stuff that I already know and It's boring
and in my eyes the college I'm going to has a lot of useless teachers that are there just for it to look good.
